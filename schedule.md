# Using this Schedule

## Accessing Readings

The majority of our readings will be available online or through [a digital course packet in Leganto](https://northeastern.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01NEU_INST/lists/9434237330001401?auth=SAML). The first time you wish to access items from Leganto you will need to log in through Blackboard (the only time we'll use it this semester), but thereafter the direct links in the schedule should work. If you switch to a new computer or device you may need to log in through Blackboard once. 

## Weekly Structure

With a few marked exceptions, the readings on the schedule below should be prepared for the first class of their respective week, which is generally a Monday. This is a studio-based course, and most weeks will be structured like so:

Mondays: discussion of readings
Wednesdays: applied instruction in a particular book technology
Thursdays: work in studio

This pace will vary a bit as the semester progresses, with no independent studio time in the early weeks of the semester, when you will not yet have a project underway, and with both Wednesday and Thursday being devoted to studio time as final project deadlines approach. 

## Studio Class Sessions

Our studio class sessions are intended to give you time to experiment with the book technologies introduced throughout the semester and to make substantive progress toward your final project. Studio classes are not optional. During studio classes—and particularly during the second half of the semester when projects are well underway—students will occasionally be asked to share what they are working on with the class for discussion and comment.
