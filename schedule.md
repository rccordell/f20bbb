# Using this Schedule

## Accessing Readings

All our readings will be available online or through a digital course packet in Leganto, which can be found through Canvas' left-hand navigation. If there's not a link directly to a text in the schedule below, check Leganto.

## Weekly Structure

Though we will mostly meet virtually in Fall 2020, I still consider this a studio course, and most weeks—with marked exceptions—will include class discussions; virtual "book labs" exploring book technologies; and open-format studio sessions. Depending on whether you are on-campus or remote, you might decide to host your studio sessions virtually or in person; if you choose the latter, your group must follow all COVID safety precautions.

With a few marked exceptions, our schedule each week will follow these formats:

### Early Semester

+ _Wednesdays_: discussion of readings, which must be prepared—and discussion prep submitted—in advance of the session
+ _Fridays_: applied book labs in a particular textual technology, sometimes synchronous—and very occasionally in-person, if public health allows—and sometimes asynchronous

### Mid- to Late-Semester

+ _Wednesdays_: discussion of readings, which must be prepared—and discussion prep submitted—in advance of the session
+ _Various days_: documented meetings of studio groups, for at least 90 minutes each week, to support final project development
+ _Biweekly_: brief check-ins with the professor, either during scheduled student hours or another arranged time

### A Note on Studio Sessions

Studio sessions are intended to give you time to experiment with the book technologies introduced throughout the semester, make substantive progress toward your final project, and get sustained feedback from your peers. Studio group meetings should happen in real-time—whether remote or in-person—and are not optional. Groups may decide to use weeks differently, perhaps simply working in proximity one week while sharing their progress another. Perhaps a group would decide to ask one member to share progress each week for part of their meeting time while devoting the rest to sustained project work. You should use this time as best supports your projects' development, but you should make use of this time, even given the strangeness of studio during a pandemic. Each studio group should document their meetings—short bullets are fine—in a format that I can access regularly, such as forum thread in Canvas. 

## A Key to the Schedule

Following each day on the schedule are two letters in parentheses, which indicate our primary modalities for that day. The first letter indicates the class' location, physical or virtual; the second indicates its temporal dimensions. _Side note: teaching in these strange times is oddly philosophical._ Here's a full rundown:

+ **R** = **Remote**. We will meet remotely, likely through zoom, or complete an activity remotely.
+ **I** = **In-person**. If public health allows, students will have the option to meet in-person to complete an activity on campus. We will reserve these moments for high-impact course activities and we must be prepared to shift online if public health guidance changes. 
+ **I/R** = **In-person/Remote**. Technically all in-person activities could be designated I/R, as students always have the option to join remotely under NUFlex. However, the I/R designation will appear on studio sessions, as each studio group can choose to meet together on campus—while following safety guidelines—or to meet remotely. 
+ **S** = **Synchronous**. We will meet together during our regularly-scheduled course time.
+ **A** = **Asynchronous**. We will not meet during our course time, but instead will complete an activity or brief assignment, posted on Canvas, within a particular window of time.
+ **S/A** = **Synchronous/Asynchronous**. This hybrid designation means I will walk through the day's activity live, at our usual scheduled course time, but am happy for you to either join me live or watch the recording and complete the activity within the designated window (for our book labs, typically 1 week). 

So, by way of example, the designation **R,S** would mean, **remote synchronous**, in which case you would expect to meet at the same time as your classmates in a virtual platform, such as zoom. **I,A** would mean **in-person asynchronous**, in which case you would expect to be scheduled to participate in an on-campus activity, such as in the letterpress studio, individually or in small groups.
