## Fieldbook Prompt

What do we talk about when we talk about *format*? For bibliographers, format has a very specific technical meaning having to do with the way a given book was laid out on the printer: folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, &c. Often—though not always—books inherited physical features of size, as well as social features of prestige, from their formats, though the *meaning* of various formats shifted over time and in different places. More recently, we tend to use the word format when discussing digital files that adhere to the standards of particular software, distinguishing a document exported in "PDF format" from one exported in "DOC format." Here too there are assumptions and even prestige that adhere to particular file formats more than others, demonstrating the strong associations humans make with particlar structures of information, as separate from the information itself. 

In this lab report, you should draw on our lab exercises and readings to unpack the meaning of a contemporary textual artifact: one related to your own life, perhaps, or one you're interested in investigating. How does your chosen text manifest physically? How do(es) its format(s) relate to its contents and cultural meaning(s)? In what ways do(es) its format(s)—and their cultural ramifications—resemble the historical-textual artifacts you worked with in our lab and learned about in our readings, and in what ways is it distinctly modern? *Important note*: as you consider what object to investigate, remember that "digital" does not mean "non-material"—digital devices still exist in the physical world!

## Station 1: Bibliography

*Key questions:* How can we use physical clues in historical books to uncover the histories of their production? What can we discern about their composition, format, and printing—and what literary-historical conclusions can we draw based on these observations?

### Station 2: Editions of *Morse's Geography*

*Key questions:* What happens to "a book" as it proliferates through multiple editions? Can we reconstruct a history of a text in/across culture/s through a set of physical artifacts?

### Station 3: A Mystery

*Key questions:* What the heck are these books anyway? And once you figure that out, what might they tell us about some functions of books in mid-nineteenth and early twentieth-century American society?
